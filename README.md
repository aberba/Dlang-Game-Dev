# Dlang-Game-Dev

Let's make games in D programming language using Raylib, Dgame, SDL2 graphics libraries! Here you can find source code for 2D games I have written in Dlang using one of the libraries mentioned above.

The main objective of this project is to inspire more people to use D programming language for their Game Dev projects, and to help newcomers and beginner programmers learn D language in a more engaging manner.

I am just starting out with D programming language and it's fantastic! Give Dlang a chance and you will love it!
